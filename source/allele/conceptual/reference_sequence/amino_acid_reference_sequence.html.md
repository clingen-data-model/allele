description: A ReferenceSequence representing the sequence of amino acids making up a polypeptide.

Scope and Usage
---------------

An AminoAcidReferenceSequence is used to denote the specific amino acid sequence resulting from the translation of a TranscriptReferenceSequence.

For example, NP_001447.2 is the AminoAcidReferenceSequence resulting from translation of TranscriptReferenceSequence NM_001456.3. 

Exclusions and Limitations
--------------------------

An arbitrary sequence of amino acids that is not the result of translating a particular TranscriptReferenceSequence is not allowed.
