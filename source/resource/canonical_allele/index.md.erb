context:
  - property: id

    definition: The logical identifier assigned by the source storage system.
    requirements: 
          
  - property: version
    control: 0..1
    type: string
    definition: The publicly stable version of the CanonicalAllele instance represented by the source system. 
    requirements: |
      Version changes may occur due to changes in the set of relatedContextualAlleles. 
          
  - property: meta
    control: 0..1
    type: Meta
    definition: The metadata about a resource. This is content in the resource that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with version changes to the resource. 
    requirements: |
      Version changes may occur due to changes in the set of relatedContextualAlleles. 
      
  - property: identifier
    control: 0..*
    type: Identifier
    definition: Business identifier(s) assigned by external authorities that represents the equivalent CanonicalAllele instance represented by the source system.
    requirements: 

  - property: relatedIdentifier
    control: 0..*
    type: Identifier
    definition: Business identifier(s) assigned by external authorities that are not exactly representative of the CanonicalAllele instance, but provide a noteworthy alternative representation.
    requirements: 
    
  - property: active
    control: 0..1
    type: boolean
    definition: Is the CanonicalAllele active, or is it invalid or superceded by a different CanonicalAllele.
    requirements: |
      The `replacement` property MUST contain one or more items if this is *true*, otherwise `replacement` MUST be empty.

  - property: replacement
    control: 0..*
    type: Replacement
    definition: The CanonicalAllele to use instead in case it is found to describe the same allele as another CanonicalAllele
    requirements: >

    definition: TODO
    requirements: >

  - property: complexity
    control: 1..1
    type: code
    binding: CanonicalAlleleComplexity
    definition: Is the CanonicalAllele represented by one ContextualAllele, or is it a composition of multiple CanonicalAlleles?
    requirements: |
      If this allele is simple, then it can contain one or more ContextualAlleles in the relatedContextualAllele property. This value is immutable.

  - property: nested
    control: 0..*
    type: CanonicalAllele
    definition: The set of CanonicalAlleles that compose this ComplexCanonicalAllele. The children CanonicalAlleles of a complex CanonicalAllele instance.
    requirements: |
      This is closely related to the CanonicalAllele.complexity and CanonicalAllele.relatedContextualAllele fields:

      * if `complexity` is simple, then this list MUST be empty
      * if `complexity` is complex, then this list MUST contain 2 or more CanonicalAlleles (each
        with `complexity` simple) AND relatedContextualAllele MUST be empty.

      Notes: - the cardinality of this property is actually 0,2..* (i.e. anything but one)
             - currently, the idea of nesting complex CanonicalAlleles within other complex CanonicalAlleles is not supported. 
      
  - property: composite
    control: 0..*
    type: CanonicalAllele
    definition: The composite, parent or complex CanonicalAllele instance(s) that this Canonical Allele is part of. 
    requirements: |
      * If this CanonicalAllele participates in one or more complex CanonicalAlleles then the `complexity` must be simple.
      * It is not requirement to pass the association to the set of complex CanonicalAlleles unless it is useful to the receiving service.

  - property: replacement
    control: 0..*
    type: 
    binding: CanonicalAllele.Replacement
    definition: The CanonicalAllele instance(s) that subsequently replaced this CanonicalAllele.  
    requirements: |
      If one or more `replacement` references exist then this CanonicalAllele should be `active` equal to false or inactive.
      
  - property: replacement.replacementType
    control: 1..1
    type: code
    binding: CanonicalAlleleReplacementType
    definition: Code for the type of replacement that occurs when CanonicalAlleles are merged or split after being published.  
    requirements: 
      
  - property: replacement.split
    control: 0..1
    type: boolean
    definition: A boolean indicating whether or not the `target` was replaced by more than one CanonicalAllele. 
    requirements: |
      It may be possible to conceptually split a pre-existing CanonicalAllele and replace it with more than one new CanonicalAllele, without actually creating all of the new replacements.  This indicator provides a definitive value to represent whether the `target` represented more than one CanonicalAllele to begin with. 
      
  - property: replacement.target
    control: 1..1
    type: CanonicalAllele
    definition: A reference to either the CanonicalAllele that replaces or is replaced-by the primary CanonicalAllele with which it is associated. 
    requirements: 
      
  - property: relatedContextualAllele
    control: 0..*
    type: 
    definition: The set of ContextualAlleles that are canonically equivalent.
    requirements: >
      If this set changes over time then the CanonicalAllele.version should be incremented to allow external references to maintain a stable representation of their original reference.

  - property: relatedContextualAllele.contextualAllele
    control: 1..1
    type: ContextualAllele
    definition: A reference to a ContextualAllele that is part of the set of CanonicalAllele.relatedContextualAlleles.
    requirements: 

  - property: relatedContextualAllele.preferred
    control: 0..1
    type: boolean
    definition: An indicator as to whether this CanonicalAllele.relatedContextualAllele is the preferred representation for the CanonicalAllele.
    requirements: |
      * The current design provides this indicator as a basic means to producing a simplified human-readable representation of the CanonicalAllele by allowing the source system to determine which related ContextualAllele is preferred over all the others.
      * One and only one of the relatedContextualAlleles must be set as the preferred one.  If a new related ContextualAllele is added or an existing one updated as preferred it would automatically override the prior related ContextualAllele that was set as preferred.

Scope and Usage
---------------

A CanonicalAllele is a reference to a sequence change, independent of any particular representation relative to a ReferenceSequence. Since alleles are represented as a change (or no change) relative to a ReferenceSequence, a CanonicalAllele is composed of potentially multiple such representations (ContextualAlleles) that correspond to the same CanonicalAllele. One ContextualAllele is selected as the preferred representation of a CanonicalAllele
