title: ReferenceSequence
layout: resource
model: allele
related_terms: reference sequence, refseq, sequence, accession
description: A versioned sequence of nucleotide bases or amino acids.
definition: Stable, reliable, public consensus sequence of a portion of the genome against which alleles are aligned and described.
requirements: For every ContextualAllele.ReferenceCoordinate there must be a corresponding reference sequence.
sequence_ontology: SO:0001411
schema: /main/resources/clingen-xsd/referencesequence.xsd
related_page_title: ReferenceSequence
related_page_url: /conceptual/reference_sequence

context:
  - property: identifier
    control: 0..*
    type: Identifier
    definition: The versioned accession that can be used to uniquely identify the sequence in a public database. All users of reference sequences SHALL be sure of the identity of the reference sequence.  Often only one identifier will be used, but if more then one reference accession is used it's required to map the same sequence.
    requirements: |
      For `ReferenceSequence`, an identifier is valid unless the accession is withdrawn. If a new version 
      of a sequence is created, it will be given a different versioned accession, and therefore a different 
      identifier. In this case, the previous identifier is still valid: it can still be used to retrieve 
      the given sequence, even if that sequence is no longer the most recent sequence associated with a 
      given entity.

  - property: referenceSequenceType
    control: 1..1
    type: code
    definition: The type of reference sequence.
    binding: |
      ReferenceSequenceType: [reference-sequence-type](/implementation/value_set_list/reference_sequence_type.html)
      (Codes identifying kinds of reference sequences)
    requirements: Currently, the supported types are transcript, gene, chromosome and amino_acid (see Binding).

  - property: chromosome
    control: 0..1
    type: code
    definition: The chromosome to which the reference sequence is naturally bound.
    binding: |
      ReferenceSequenceChromosome: [reference-sequence-chromosome](/implementation/value_set_list/reference_sequence_chromosome.html) (Codes identifying human chromosomes.)
    requirements: This should be provided when the sequence represents a 'chromosome'.

  - property: cdsStart
    control: 0..1
    type: integer
    definition: |
      The offset of the start of the coding region from the start of the reference sequence. This should be provided when the sequence represents a 'transcript'.
      
      NOTE: Unlike reference coordinates, this is a 1-based index representing the position of the nucleotide that starts the coding region.

  - property: cdsEnd
    control: 0..1
    type: integer
    definition: |
      The offset of the end of the coding region from the start of the reference sequence. This should be provided when the sequence represents a 'transcript'.
      
      NOTE: Unlike reference coordinates, this is a 1-based index representing the position of the nucleotide that ends the coding region.

  - property: gene
    control: 0..1
    type: Resource([Gene](../gene/index.html))
    definition: Identifies the gene related to a 'gene' or 'transcript' reference sequence.

  - property: referenceGenome
    control: 0..1
    type: CodeableConcept
    definition: The genome build in which the chromosomal reference sequence is referenced. 
    requirements: The current version of the model does not provide for the same version of a chromosomal reference sequence to be associated with more than one reference genome build.

  - property: related
    control: 0..1
    definition: The relationship between a different reference sequence to provide additional context. 
    requirements: |
      The current version of the resource only defines relationship type terminology bindings 
      to support the relationship between transcript and amino acid reference sequences.

  - property: related.relatedType
    control: 0..1
    type: code
    definition: The type or relationship between an amino acid and transcript or vice versa.
    binding: |
      ReferenceSequenceRelationshipType: [reference-sequence-relationship-type](/implementation/value_set_list/reference_sequence_relationship_type.html) (Codes describing the relationships between ReferenceSequences)

  - property: related.target
    control: 0..1
    type: Resource([ReferenceSequence](index.html))
    definition: The target reference sequence for the specified related.relatedType.

Scope and Usage
---------------

All alleles are described relative to a ReferenceSequence by way of the ContextualAllele.ReferenceCoordinate 
[see ContextualAllele](../contextual_allele/index.html). Both the ContextualAllele position (or coordinate) and sequence 
at that postion are relative to the ReferenceSequence.

The current version of the model was based on four specific types of conceptual reference sequences; 
ChromosomeReferenceSequence, GeneReferenceSequence, TranscriptReferenceSequence and AminoAcidReferenceSequence.

Notes
-----

* This version of the ReferenceSequence resource only considers the related reference sequence associations 
between amino acid and transcript reference sequences. This has constrained the scope of codes in the 
[value set](/implementation/value_set_list/reference_sequence_relationship_type.html) for the 
ReferenceSequence.related.relatedType attribute.
