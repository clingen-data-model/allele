Introduction
------------

The assertion model is intended to model assertions made about entities within the ClinGen project, including alleles, genes, and the clinical actionability of genetic information. We model the provenance of an assertion as it moves through the levels of curation, from an assertion made by an individual genetic testing lab, to an assertion made by a ClinGen approved expert panel. To this end, we have decided to incorporate [the Provennace model developed by the W3C](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/) to represent the flow of provenance through our model.

The assertion model is still in early conceptual development and is subject to rapid change (and even internal conflict). Please feel free to comment about our general approach and methods (see our [GitHub project](https://github.com/)).
