PVS1 null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical ±1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multiexon deletion) in a gene where LOF is a known mechanism of disease
PS1 Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change
PS2 De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history
PS3 Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product
PS4 The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared with the prevalence in controls
PM1 Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g., active site of an enzyme) without benign variation
PM2 Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) (Table 6) in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium
PM3 For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant
PM4 Protein length changes as a result of in-frame deletions/insertions in a nonrepeat region or stop-loss variants
PM5 Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before
PM6 Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity
PP1 Cosegregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease
PP2 Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and in which missense variants are a common mechanism of disease
PP3 Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.)
PP4 Patient’s phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology
PP5 Reputable source recently reports variant as pathogenic, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation
BA1 Allele frequency is >5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium
BS1 Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder
BS2 Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age
BS3 Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing
BS4 Lack of segregation in affected members of a family
BP1 Missense variant in a gene for which primarily truncating variants are known to cause disease
BP2 Observed in trans with a pathogenic variant for a fully penetrant dominant gene/disorder or observed in cis with a pathogenic variant in any inheritance pattern
BP3 In-frame deletions/insertions in a repetitive region without a known function
BP4 Multiple lines of computational evidence suggest no impact on gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.)
BP5 Variant found in a case with an alternate molecular basis for disease
BP6 Reputable source recently reports variant as benign, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation
BP7 A synonymous (silent) variant for which splicing prediction algorithms predict no impact to the splice consensus sequence nor the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved
