MechanismOfDisease	BP1
MolecularEffect	PVS1	What is the relationship to molecular effect in the allele model?
MolecularEffect	PS1	Do we want a single MolecularEffect to cover all of the cases, e.g. LOF vs missense etc.
MolecularEffect	PM4
MolecularEffect	PM5
MolecularEffect	PP2
MolecularEffect	BP1 
MolecularEffect	BP7 
MolecularEffect	BP3
BenignMissenseVariationRate	PP2	Rate is probably a qualitative thing?
InSilicoPrediction	BP4
InSilicoPrediction	PP3
InSilicoPrediction	BP7	Prediction must be splicing prediction
RegionAnnotation	PM1	Do we need to allow for noncontiguous regions?  Difference between hotspot and functional region?
RegionAnnotation	BP3
RegionAnnotation	PM4	If the change is in a repeat region it is less interesting.
FunctionalData	PS3	Do we need more detailed modeling (No)
FunctionalData	BS3
PopulationAlleleFrequency	BA1
PopulationAlleleFrequency	BS1
PopulationAlleleFrequency	PM2
IndividualAlleles	BS2
IndividualAlleles	BP5
IndividualAlleles	BP2
IndividualAlleles	PM3	One of the alleles is the one being interpreted and the other is the one in the pathogenicinterpretation element.
FamilyHistory	PP4	Individual w/ family history for a condition, then OtherGenes saying condition is gene speciric?
FamilyHistory	PS2
FamilyHistory	PM6
DeNovoAllele	PS2	?fold denovoallele into individualalleles?
DeNovoAllele	PM6	?fold denovoallele into individualalleles?
IndividualConditions	BS2	(Using isHealthyControl)
IndividualConditions	BP5
CaseControl	PS4
Segregation	PP1
Segregation	BS4
OtherGenesAreAssociatedWithCondition	PP4	Should this be condition or individual?
PathogenicityInterpretation	PS1	Is this entity just an interpretation, or is it evidence saying that there is an interpretation?
PathogenicityInterpretation	PM1	This is the benign allele interpretation
PathogenicityInterpretation	PM3
PathogenicityInterpretation	PM5	A pathogenic interpretation of a different aminoacid change at the same location.
PathogenicityInterpretation	BP2
PathogenicityInterpretation	BP5
PathogenicityInterpretation	BP6
Conservation	BP7
