MechanismOfDisease	BP1
MolecularEffect	PVS1	What is the relationship to molecular effect in the allele model?
MolecularEffect	PS1	Do we want a single MolecularEffect to cover all of the cases, e.g. LOF vs missense etc.
MolecularEffect	PM4
MolecularEffect	PM5
MolecularEffect	PP2
MolecularEffect	BP1 
MolecularEffect	BP7 
MolecularEffect	BP3
BenignMissenseVariationRate	PP2	Rate is probably a qualitative thing?
InSilicoPrediction	BP4
InSilicoPrediction	PP3
InSilicoPrediction	BP7	Prediction must be splicing prediction
RegionAnnotation	PM1	Do we need to allow for noncontiguous regions?  Difference between hotspot and functional region?
RegionAnnotation	BP3
RegionAnnotation	PM4	If the change is in a repeat region it is less interesting.
FunctionalData	PS3	Do we need more detailed modeling (No)
FunctionalData	BS3

Individual	PM6
Individual	BP5	The case with the alternative explaination and the current allele.
Individual	PP4	Include some information about the symptoms?
Individual.FamilialAllele	PS2
Individual.FamilialAllele	PM6
Individual.PhasedAlleles	PM3	One of the alleles is the one being interpreted and the other is the one in the pathogenicinterpretation element.

Segregation	PP1
Segregation	BS4
OtherGenesAreAssociatedWithCondition	PP4	Should this be condition or individual?
PathogenicityInterpretation	PS1	Is this entity just an interpretation, or is it evidence saying that there is an interpretation?
PathogenicityInterpretation	PM1	This is the benign allele interpretation
PathogenicityInterpretation	PM3
PathogenicityInterpretation	PM5	A pathogenic interpretation of a different aminoacid change at the same location.
