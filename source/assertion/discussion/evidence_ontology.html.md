Introduction
------------

The Evidence Ontology (ECO) is potentially a useful way for typing evidence and structuring it within a useful hierarchy. It offers the potential to avoid duplicating existing work and having to build our own type hierarchy for evidence.

Application to evidence types used in variant curation
------------------------------------------------------

### Links to external resources (may require access to ClinGen Confluence site):
* [Gene related features necessary for variant curation](https://ncbiconfluence.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/display/CLIN/ACMG+variant+curation+support)
* [Proposed variant curation data fields](https://ncbiconfluence.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/display/CLIN/Proposed+Variant+Curation+Data+Fields)

These evidence types are based off of the categories specified in the 2015 ACMG variant curation criteria.

### Sidenote: use of canonical/allele instance as evidence

Many evidence types are going to be based on annotation made on a variant. Is it correct to use the reference to either the allele instance, or a canonical variant with associated allele instance, that has the appropriate type? (Null variant:
