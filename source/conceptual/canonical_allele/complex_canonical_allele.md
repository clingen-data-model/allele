title: ComplexCanonicalAllele
layout: conceptual
model: allele
description: A stable identifier for a complex allele, defined as a series of two or more SimpleCanonicalAlleles that occur in cis.

Scope and Usage
---------------

ComplexCanonicalAllele is an abstract class; any instance of ComplexCanonicalAllele must be either a ComplexNucleotideCanonicalAllele or a ComplexAminoAcidCanonicalAllele.

A ComplexCanonicalAllele is an aggregation of two or more SimpleCanonicalAlleles, and provides a way to attach assertions or observations to the that collection.  The assertion that a particular person has a ComplexCanonicalAllele is equivalent to the assertion that they contain all of the SimpleCanonicalAlleles in *cis* (i.e. on the same copy of the chromosome).  

ComplexCanonicalAllele is a suitable class for describing pharmacogenomic star alleles or other haplotypes.

Because the ComplexCanonicalAllele is defined as an aggregation of SimpleCanonicalAlleles, canonicalization of the complex alleles is straightforward: every unique combination of SimpleCanonicalAlleles is already canonicalized.  

Exclusions and Limitations
--------------------------

ComplexCanonicalAllele is exclusivly used for alleles in *cis*.  It can not be used to represent, e.g. compound heterozygotes.

Concrete aggregation must occur at either the nucleotide or protein level; there is no way to build a complex allele that involves one SimpleNucleotideCanonicalAllele and one SimpleAminoAcidCanonicalAllele.

There is exactly one level of aggregation: SimpleCanonicalAlleles are aggregated to ComplexCanonicalAlleles, but ComplexCanonicalAlleles cannot be further aggregated to new ComplexCanonicalAlleles.  In this case, a new ComplexCanonicalAllele must be created based on the union of all of the involved SimpleCanonicalAlleles.
