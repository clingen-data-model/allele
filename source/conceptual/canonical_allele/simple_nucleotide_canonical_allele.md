title: SimpleNucleotideCanonicalAllele
layout: conceptual
model: allele
description: A stable identifier for a nucleotide allele instance, grouping together the different ways that the allele might be described across different versions of different GenomeReferences and TranscriptReferenceSequences.

---

Scope and Usage
---------------

SimpleNucleotideCanonicalAlleles aggregate different NucleotideContextualAlleles that are different representations of the same genetic variation.   Potentially, this aggregates all the versions of the allele in different GenomicReferenceSequences, as well as a TranscriptContextualAllele for any transcript that maps to any of those GenomicReferenceSequences.

Exclusions and Limitations
--------------------------

Aggregation of TranscriptContextualAlleles with GenomicContextualAlleles requires the mapping of a TranscriptReferenceSequence to a GenomicReferenceSequence, and the identification of the Alleles will depend on the details of the mapping process.  A more complete version of the allele model would incorporate information about the transcript alignment.
